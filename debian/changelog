xmltooling (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * Bump SONAME of libxmltooling following upstream's versioning.
  * Include <cstdio> in base.h since some of its macros use sprintf.
    Fixes FTBFS for packages using xmltooling with GCC 4.4 that don't
    already include cstdio.  Thanks, Martin Michlmayr.  (Closes: #505072)

xmltooling (1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Add dependencies to libxmltooling-dev for the packages whose header
    files are included by XMLTooling headers.
  * Include NOTICE.txt in all packages.

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Explicitly link with -lpthread to work around Bug#468555 in libtool.
  * Change package priorities to extra.  Xerces-C is extra, so all of the
    Shibboleth stack needs to be extra, and realistically it's somewhat of
    an edge package in Debian.
  * Add in copyright and license information for all of the other random
    files in the tree, including all the Autoconf support files.
  * Fix copyright file formatting to use the right syntax for Files.
