xmltooling (1.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add explicit build dependency on libssl-dev, which is used directly by
    this package, and force build dependency on libssl-dev 1.0 or later
    for consistent build results.  If some Shibboleth-related libraries
    are built against earlier versions of libssl, it produces linking
    failures when building the Shibboleth SP package.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Apr 2011 14:41:37 -0700

xmltooling (1.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FTBFS with arch-only builds, such as those on the buildds.
    Thanks, Aaron M. Ucko.  (Closes: #618615)

    - Improve handling of simple content when comments are present
    - Fix configure probing with ld --as-needed (Closes: #606486)

    build results.
  * Add build dependency on pkg-config, which upstream now uses to find
    the SSL libraries.
  * Add build dependency on graphviz for better API documentation.
  * Replace the version of jQuery installed by Doxygen in the
    documentation package with a symlink to the version supplied by the
    Debian package and add a dependency.

    - Use the autotools-dev debhelper module for config.{sub,guess}.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization.
  * Clean some additional files not removed by upstream make distclean.
  * Update debian/copyright to the current DEP-5 specification.
  * Change to Debian source format 3.0 (quilt).  Force a single Debian
    patch for simplicity since the packaging is maintained in Git using
    branches, and include a patch header explaining why.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).

  * Force source format 1.0 for now since it makes backporting easier.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to all package dependencies.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 13 May 2010 10:03:36 -0700

xmltooling (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency set to high for security fix.
  * New upstream release.
    - SECURITY: Partial fix for improper handling of URLs that could be
      abused for script injection and other cross-site scripting attacks.
      The complete fix also requires newer opensaml2 and shibboleth-sp2
      packages.  (CVE-2009-3300)
    - Add setter for KeyInfoResolver object.
    - Fix extraction of cert info for UTF-8 handling changes.
    - Fix passing of TransportOption configuration to cURL.
    - Fix instability in reusing a DOM after signing it.
    - Remove xmlns:xml namespace declaration when marshalling and
      unmarshalling to avoid canonicalization bugs.
  * Rename library package for upstream SONAME bump.
  * Build-depend on libxml-security-c-dev 1.5 or later and make
    libxmltooling-dev depend on libxml-security-c-dev 1.5 or later to
    ensure that all builds are consistent.  Although this package will
    build with 1.4, the other packages built on xmltooling require 1.5.

    - Fix other validation issues with malformed objects.
    - Fix for accessing the resolution context, which affects the ability
      of callers to restrict keys based on use attributes.
    - Fix encoding of backup metadata.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V7.
    - Use dh_prep instead of dh_clean -k.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.3 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Aug 2009 11:31:37 -0700

  * New upstream release.
    - Stop dropping the namespace of qualified attributes that aren't
      extensions.
    - Expose multiple certificate revocation lists via the credential
      API, allowing separate revocation lists for intermediate certs.
    - Provide the hostname in artifact resolution errors.
    - Sanity-check provided credentials for consistency.

xmltooling (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * Bump SONAME of libxmltooling following upstream's versioning.
  * Include <cstdio> in base.h since some of its macros use sprintf.
    Fixes FTBFS for packages using xmltooling with GCC 4.4 that don't
    already include cstdio.  Thanks, Martin Michlmayr.  (Closes: #505072)

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Fix watch file for upstream directory structure.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Feb 2009 17:23:00 -0800

xmltooling (1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Add dependencies to libxmltooling-dev for the packages whose header
    files are included by XMLTooling headers.
  * Include NOTICE.txt in all packages.

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Explicitly link with -lpthread to work around Bug#468555 in libtool.
  * Change package priorities to extra.  Xerces-C is extra, so all of the
    Shibboleth stack needs to be extra, and realistically it's somewhat of
    an edge package in Debian.
  * Add in copyright and license information for all of the other random
    files in the tree, including all the Autoconf support files.
  * Fix copyright file formatting to use the right syntax for Files.
