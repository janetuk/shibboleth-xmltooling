Package: libxmltooling5
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: C++ XML parsing library with encryption support (runtime)
 The XMLTooling library contains generic XML parsing and processing
 classes based on the Xerces-C DOM.  It adds more powerful facilities for
 declaring element- and type-specific API and implementation classes, as
 well as signing and encryption support.
 .
 This package contains the files necessary for running applications that
 use the XMLTooling library.
