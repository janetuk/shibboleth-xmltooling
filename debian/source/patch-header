Subject: Collected Debian patches for xmltooling
Author: Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>

The packaging for xmltooling is maintained in Git using multiple
branches for fixes, which makes it complex to separate the changes easily
into individual patches.  They are therefore all included in a single
Debian branch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repsitory.
